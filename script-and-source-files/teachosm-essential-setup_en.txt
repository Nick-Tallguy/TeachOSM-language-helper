What is OpenStreetMap?
OpenStreetMap is the free and open web map of the world. Anyone can edit OpenStreetMap and it supports a level of granularity not common to maps produced by official agencies. Because of that, OpenStreetMap is an ideal platform for teaching the fundamentals of geography, such as place, space, and location.
