# TeachOSM-language-helper

1st File for translation
------------------------

In the folder 'script-and-source-files is a file  **teachosm-essential-setup_en.txt**  

This is a sample file and would be the first thing to get translated. The lines that start with # **in this file only** are information lines just to help the admin person place the information in the right place. Anything starting with # **in this file only** does not need translating. 

### Instructions

**Either**
-  Download the file to translate, rename it teachosm-essential-setup_xx.txt (where xx represents the language code such as 'de', 'es' or 'fr') and translate the lines that do not begin with a # (this only applies to essential-setup file.)  
or  
-  Upload the file to Transifex and wait for it to be translated before downloading the new translation.  
and  
-  Then place the translated version (make sure the language code is in place) in the **from-transifex** folder.  


Progress
--------

File 'teachosm-essential-setup.txt' has been created & can be used to start the translation process.

Decision needed as to how translations will be done - awaiting contact to know what further involvement?
